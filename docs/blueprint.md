## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to evoke serenity and spirituality.
- Background color: Very light off-white (#F8F8FF), near the lavender in hue, for a clean, peaceful backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted gold (#D4AF37) for highlighting important elements, conveying wisdom and enlightenment.
- Body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) combines modern look and warmth; Headline: 'Playfair' (serif) gives elegant feel
- Use serene, minimalist icons with spiritual or religious motifs (e.g., mandalas, lotus flowers) with muted gold accents.
- Design a clean, uncluttered layout with ample white space to promote a sense of peace and clarity. Prioritize intuitive navigation with bottom tabs for key sections.
- Incorporate subtle, gentle animations for transitions and feedback (e.g., smooth scrolling, fading effects) to enhance user experience.
