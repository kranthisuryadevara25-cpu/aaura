/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Mythalogical App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-generated content (videos, channels, horoscopes, orders),
 * ensuring that only the authenticated user can create, read, update, or delete their own data. Products are publicly readable,
 * but write access is not granted in this prototype. Subscriptions are accessible with proper user authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: User profiles and related data.
 * - `/users/{userId}/videos/{videoId}`: Videos uploaded by users.
 * - `/users/{userId}/channels/{channelId}`: Channels created by users.
 * - `/users/{userId}/horoscopes/{horoscopeId}`: Horoscopes generated for users.
 * - `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}`: Orders placed by users.
 * - `/orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}`: Order items associated with orders.
 * - `/products/{productId}`: Products in the spiritual marketplace (globally accessible for reading).
 * - `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`: User subscriptions to channels.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied.
 * - No admin roles are defined, defaulting to user-only access.
 * - Ambiguous relationships default to strict owner-only access.
 * - Document IDs are expected to be auto-generated, but this is not enforced in the rules.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * All user-owned documents under `/users/{userId}` are expected to have a `userId` field matching the path.
 * This allows for simpler `isOwner()` checks without additional `get()` calls.
