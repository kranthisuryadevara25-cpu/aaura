/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the aaura app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data protection while allowing public access to media and temple information.
 * Users can only manage their own data, while media content and temple data are publicly readable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User-specific data (profiles, bookmarks, subscriptions, horoscopes) is nested under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Public content (media, channels, deities, shops, products, temples, stories, characters, rituals, panchang, festivals) resides in top-level collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own user documents and associated subcollections.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - Media, Temples and other content are publicly readable but writable only with proper authorization (TODO).
 * - Assumes all top-level collections, except users, should be world-readable.
 * - Schema validation is relaxed to allow rapid iteration. Only relational integrity is strictly enforced.
