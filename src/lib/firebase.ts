// This file is intentionally left blank.
// Firebase initialization is now handled by the provider pattern in:
// - src/lib/firebase/client.ts (for client-side)
// - src/lib/firebase/server.ts (for server-side)
// - src/lib/firebase/provider.tsx (React provider and hooks)
// This prevents SDK state corruption between server and client environments.
